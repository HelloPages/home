There exist two varieties of Dhanush films: one tailored to his fans where he embodies the typical Tamil movie hero, and another, still for his fans, where he adopts a subtler, more relatable persona. This film falls into the latter category.

The movie itself is straightforward, adhering to the 8-point story arc with a character, their thoughts, conflicts, relationships, choices, reversals, and resolutions. Its brilliance lies in the clarity and finesse of its execution. Nithya Menen, Bharathiraja, and Prakash Raj charmingly fulfill their roles, while Raashii Khanna meets her character's demands precisely - good looking and disconnected.

Anirudh's musical contributions significantly enhance the film, particularly with the tracks "*Thenmozhi*" and "*Megham Karukatha*".
