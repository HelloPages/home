### Devices
I utilise a MacBook Pro for office tasks, without delving into our tech and communication stack. We primarily rely on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design ideation and UI creation.

Gradually, I've been transitioning my personal activities to an iPad Pro 2020, acquired during the Covid lockdown. Thus far, I've successfully migrated most routine tasks to it. Additionally, I own a Google Pixel 3a featuring [Before Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beforesoft.launcher&hl=en_IN&gl=US) and [95% of notifications disabled](https://medium.com/make-time/six-years-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-8cf5eb4f97e3).

### Reading
In October 2023, I purchased a new [Kindle Paperwhite](https://amzn.to/3nGZ5nY), upgrading from a second-hand 2013 model I had used for the past 6-7 years. This device is my primary reading tool. Occasionally, I turn to [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) for reading and annotating PDFs.

To complement my Kindle, I employ [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for e-book organization and the [Kindle Highlight](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin) plugin to transfer bookmarks to Obsidian. For managing bookmarks efficiently, I rely on [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/)
### Design
[Figma](https://figma.com) is my preferred tool for design needs (see [[Figma Resources]]). Occasionally, I use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for raster and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector designs. The [Procreate App](https://procreate.art/) on my iPad is another favorite.

### Writing
Organizing and storing notes in written form aids my learning and helps me connect topics. Formerly an [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) user, I now use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-based [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for writing. For shared notes, I turn to [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). Additionally, I employ [Audiopen](https://audiopen.ai/) to capture audio and convert it to text â€“ perfect for solo brainstorming.

### Analog Tools
During meetings and brainstorming sessions, I enjoy jotting down ideas on paper. My analog note-taking is inspired by the Bullet Journal method (read [How I use Bullet Journal](https://hiran.in/writing/bullet-journal)). Currently, I use a [Neorah Dotted Journal](https://amzn.to/3IQX7ys), along with ink pens like [TWSBI Eco](https://amzn.to/3h2FLyU), [Jinhao](https://amzn.to/3XBuXvs), and [Lamy Safari Finetip](https://amzn.to/3OHOs4z), plus a [Uni-Ball Kuru Toga](https://amzn.to/45PbjRZ) for sketching.

### Malayalam Input
For Malayalam typing, I use [Indic Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.smc.inputmethod.indic&hl=en&gl=US) on Android, [Varamozhi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/varamozhi/id514987251) on iPad, and [Keymagic](https://junix.in/keymagic-with-malayalam/) on Mac (read [[Installing Malayalam keyboard in Mac]]).

### Listening
[YTMusic](https://music.youtube.com/) is my sole music source due to its vast regional content. For podcasts, I use [PocketCast](https://pocketcasts.com) and [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/). Audiobooks are typically consumed via [Audible](https://www.audible.in/), [Storytel](https://www.storytel.com/in/en/), [KuKu FM](https://kukufm.page.link/LQiRZbrFGhBm4U8y5), and occasionally [Voice app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ph1b.audiobook&hl=en_IN&gl=US).

### Tech Stack
[NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) manages my domains, while [GitHub](https://github.com/) stores and
Publishing the website, I favor [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my code-editor and recently adopted [PolyGit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polygit-git-client/id1508942822) for Git maintenance on my iPad.

### Coffee
Brewing coffee and enhancing its profile has become my latest interest and hobby. I employ methods such as [[AeroPress]], [[Moka Pot]], and [[Filter Coffee]], using equipment like a [Scale](https://amzn.to/3v5hNhw), [Thermometer](https://amzn.to/4avufam), [Electric Kettle](https://amzn.to/3tr6IqA), [Timer.Coffee App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffee.timer) as timer.

### Other Apps
For project management, I suggest [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) if you value documentation and clarity. For simpler tasks, consider using [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Todoist](https://todoist.com/). Jira isn't always necessary. [Linear](https://linear.app/) and [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) offer advanced tech project management solutions.

Regarding storage, Dropbox, iCloud, and Google Drive are recommended based on your preferences. I use all three's free tiers, but my primary storage is a lesser-known tool called [PCloud](https://my.pcloud.com/), which has served me well for eight years.

In terms of browsers, I remain partial to [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for its contributions to the tech community. Among Chromium-based options, I lean towards [Arc](https://arc.net/) due to its unique perspective rather than mere copy-branding.
