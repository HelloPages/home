I'm tweaking how I work to get more things done. I'm trying out a new approach: checking progress every 20 hours. I'm also redoing the <a href="https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io">Jekyll Garden</a> theme, writing more notes, updating designs for <a href="https://gpura.org/">Grandhapura</a>, and supporting <a href="https://circuitverse.org/">Circuit Verse</a> in Google Summer of Code mentoring.
