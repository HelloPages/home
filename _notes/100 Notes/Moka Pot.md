Thanks to [Nicola Junior Vitto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolajuniorvitto/), my Italian former manager, the Moka Pot is now a staple in our kitchen, as ubiquitous as [[Filter Coffee]]. I particularly enjoy using medium/dark roast or South Indian Coffee powder with this device. 

James Hoffmann offers [an in-depth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDLoIvb0w4) on how to use this apparatus. The two essential tips I follow when brewing coffee with the Moka Pot are adding hot water (70-80C) instead of room temperature water and maintaining the lowest heat once boiling commences.
