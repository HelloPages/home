I have tried making coffee using [[AeroPress Recipe for Dark Roasted]] recipe, with South Indian Coffee Powder, and it's worth mentioning! What I did is I reduced the temperature (which can reduce the bitterness) and increased the water (diluting it)

- Step 1: Add 13gm of [Cothas Coffee powder](https://amzn.to/4883fMw)
- Step 2: Add 200ml of 80c water
- Step 3: Place plunger and wait for 50 seconds
- Step 4: Press for 20-30 seconds, and do stop **before** the hiss
- Done.
