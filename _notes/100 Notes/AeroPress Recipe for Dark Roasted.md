For Dark roasted, I have tried two methods that gave good result. 

## Recipe 1 - 
[v60 style](https://aeroprecipe.com/recipes/v60-style-aeropress-dark) is one of the most famous AeroPress recipe you can see online. It's simple, and you get a good result every time. 

Here is how I do, the values are different since I use Aeropress Go, with max capacity of 245ml.

- Use 2 paper filters. No preheating, or filter rinsing. Keep AeroPress in Standard position.
- Step 1: Add 13gm of medium grid coffee powder
- Step 2: Add 150ml of 85-90c water

- Step 4: Press for 20-30 seconds, and do stop **before** the hiss
- Done.
