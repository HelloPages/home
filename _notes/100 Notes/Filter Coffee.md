South Indian Coffee, or Filter Coffee goes well with milk, and is excellent companion to South Indian breakfast staples. The coffee powder, derived from Arabica beans, includes Chicory, altering both flavour and aroma. Typically finely ground, the Coffee-Chicory ratio ranges from 90:10 to 60:40. My personal preference is around 80:20, and I favourite [Cothas Coffee powder](https://amzn.to/4883fMw)  powder over others.

The equipment—a filter—is straightforward, utilising the basic principle of gravity. With no pressure and a high brewing time, a thick concentrate (decoction) is produced. It's available [online](https://amzn.to/48jVraw).

The entire process is uncomplicated, with minimal room for error. The best instruction manual I've encountered is [this video of Venkatesh Bhat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlFLS-QMHfo).
